# Experience

## Vocational

Nov 2022–May 2024  
Senior Data Engineer  
Cue Health  
San Diego, CA  

- Led the design and implementation of a custom data pipeline using Go
  to extract, store, and transform real-time manufacturing data,
  handling 15 million images/month on the order of petabytes per year in
  total.
  - Developed a custom caching system across goroutines called through
    Cloud Run to ensure minimal query counts within BigQuery. Reduced
    image indexing costs by 94% versus a non-cached system.
- Led the data engineering team in implementing a system for collecting,
  processing, and presenting manufacturing data. This provided the first
  automated calculation of overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) at Cue.
  It improved new product development, field failure analysis, and
  manufacturing efficiency.
- Took over as lead software engineer for the internal cartridge
  application built with TypeScript. Developed changes to implement
  reporting on multiplex tests for internal teams.
- Designed an improved second iteration on the first data lake
  architecture for Cue that emphasizes self-service approaches and an
  analytics engineering focus using Dagster, dbt, BigQuery, and Looker.

Mar 2022–Oct 2022  
Data Engineer  
Cue Health  
San Diego, CA  

- Created a custom server-less data pipeline in Python for streaming
  billions of rows from noncompliant CSV files into a BigQuery table.
- My first architecture presentation set the standard and was described
  by the chief architect as “the best and most comprehensive.”
- Lead engineer on migrating the Cue marketing team from the Salesforce
  Datorama platform to an in-house data lake approach with BigQuery and
  Looker. Moved 7 marketing connectors over from Datorama to the new
  architecture.
- Designed and built Cue's first data lake platform using services and
  tools such as Fivetran, BigQuery, dbt, and Looker.
  - Took the data platform from 2 models to a large DAG of over 1,500
    SQL transformation models.
  - Created a data lake that could account for GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, and
    SOX requirements.
